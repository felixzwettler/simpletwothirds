# simpletwothirds
a simple Pico CMS theme with responsive web design. Used by me as a wiki and blog.

I am not a web developer. At best this is ugly code, at worst it might be unsafe. Use at your own risk.

## Installation
takes only Pico seconds. Just upload the theme into the themes folder and enable this theme in the `config.yml`.
It is still under heavy developement, so it may change drastically. Feel free to fork the code.

Also: Please don't hesitate to submit an issue, I am always open for improvements / changes. I consider this theme as tipping my little toe into the water in regards to web developement.
